# Titleable Code Plugin
This is a fork of the seemingly abandoned [Code plugin by Ignap](https://github.com/lgnap/dokuwiki-plugin-code/) for DokuWiki.
This plugin replaces the `<code>` tag with one which allows you to add a title. Using the syntax as normal should still work the same.

## Syntax 
The syntax to add a title is as follows:
```
<code lang | title>
/* Your code here */
</code>
```
This should produce a code block with syntax highlighting for `lang` with the title `title`.
